The Visualizing [Atlantis](http://atlantis.cmar.csiro.au/) Toolbox, VAT, is developed by Christopher David Desjardins at the [Science Institute at the University of Iceland](http://raunvis.hi.is/rhformE.php) as a part of the [EU MareFrame project](http://www.mareframe-fp7.org/). VAT is released under the [GPL v3 or later](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and source code is available at [http://github.com/cddesja](http://github.com/cddesja).

At present, VAT is able to:
- Replicate functionality of Olive
- Present a series of animated GIFs showing changes in biomass over time for the functional group.
- Breakdown relative biomass, spawning stock biomass, and YOY biomass by functional group.
- Show the diet matrix

VAT involves some preparation of files offline, particularly the GIFs using [animation](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html), in order to use the interactive interface fully.
